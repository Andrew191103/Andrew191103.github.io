                <h2><b>Grilled Dorade, Vernick Fish</b></h2>
                <p>While Jean-Georges Vongerichten took the penthouse at the new Four Seasons in Philadelphia, his protégé Greg Vernick holds it down on the first floor with his ode to the oyster bar, Vernick Fish. Arriving in late summer 2019, it was one of the best new seafood restaurants to open across the country. This butterflied and grilled dorade is served with a pumpkin seed and arbol chile salsa macha.

                <h2><b>Pheasantt, Wherewithall</b></h2>
                <p>Beverly Kim and Johnny Clark's encore to Michelin-starred Parachute is an egalitarian tasting menu spot in the mold of Contra in New York or Chateaubriand in Paris. The final savory course was a pheasant with perfectly crispy skin and mushrooms over a mousse that has a slight tanginess, which provided a nice balance to the earthiness of the mushrooms and bird. it's aight in my opinnion

                <h2>Blue Crab Meatballs and Spaghetti</h2>
                <p>At Danny Meyer's DC debut, Maialino Mare, chef Rose Noel created a seafood-centric Italian menu that incorporated some outstanding mid-Atlantic catch. A standout of her selections was the spaghetti and meatballs that seemed pretty standard upon first look, but were actually generous lumps of blue crab formed together and disguised to look like your garden variety meatball. They were anything but.</p>
